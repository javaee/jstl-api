/**
 * <p>Base support class to facilitate implementation of iteration tags.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since most iteration tags will behave identically with respect to
 * actual iterative behavior, JSTL provides this
 * base support class to facilitate implementation.  Many iteration tags
 * will extend this and merely implement the <tt>hasNext()</tt> and 
 * <tt>next()</tt> methods
 * to provide contents for the handler to iterate over.</p>
 *
 * <p>In particular, this base class provides support for:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *  <li> Iteration control, based on protected <tt>prepare()</tt>, <tt>next()</tt>,
 *       and <tt>hasNext()</tt> methods
 *  <li> Subsetting (<tt>begin</tt>, <tt>end</tt>, <tt>step></tt>functionality, 
 *       including validation
 *       of subset parameters for sensibility)
 *  <li> item retrieval (<tt>getCurrent()</tt>)
 *  <li> status retrieval (<tt>LoopTagStatus</tt>)
 *  <li> exposing attributes (set by <tt>var</tt> and <tt>varStatus</tt> attributes)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In providing support for these tasks, <tt>LoopTagSupport</tt> contains
 * certain control variables that act to modify the iteration.  Accessors
 * are provided for these control variables when the variables represent
 * information needed or wanted at translation time (e.g., <tt>var</tt>, 
 * <tt>varStatus</tt>).  For
 * other variables, accessors cannot be provided here since subclasses
 * may differ on their implementations of how those accessors are received.
 * For instance, one subclass might accept a <tt>String</tt> and convert it into
 * an object of a specific type by using an expression evaluator; others
 * might accept objects directly.  Still others might not want to expose
 * such information to outside control.</p>
